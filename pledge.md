We believe that businesses have a moral obligation to consider what they are enabling with their work.  As such we pledge to have an internally transparent system for evaluating new contracts in terms of their impact.  We will have this contract evaluation system in place within six months.  Any organization, including government agencies, which is stripping people of life or liberty without due process is not a group we will hold a contract with.

In addition we will not take new contracts or renew contracts with any group on Southern Poverty Law Centerâ€™s list of hate groups.  If a group disguises themselves and we discover it we will terminate the contract as soon as is legally feasible and donate their contract value to an organization working to counter that harm.

Other pledges we will evaluate and consider taking include:
Never again pledge
