# ethics_pledge
Tech is not morally neutral.  As we've seen lately with the backlash from ICE contracts as well as Facebook's stand on political advertising executive policies around morality can have material impacts on buisnesses.

This repository is an attempt to turn that dynamic around - instead of being in fear of people leaving due to bad policies here's a place to collect policies that we can all celebrate.  Policies we can all look for on job pages so people with heart and moral compasses can flock to ethical organizations and make them even stronger.

We make change by working together to create the world we want to see.  Please feel free to contribute PRs for what you think that would look like, to use these policies at your comapny, or modify these to help us build a more just world.

The ful text of the pledge is in [pledge.md](./pledge.md).
